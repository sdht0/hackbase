Hackbase
========
This was a hacking/wargame contest I had organised in my college. 13 levels of quite basic challenges.

To play
-------
This needs a 4 server setup. Because of the interdependencies and a specific initialization sequence, I've dockerized all of them. 

Just execute `play.sh` to start the servers. Link will be generated at the end of initialization. Have fun!

Note that this will download docker binaries from the registry. Alternatively, you can build the Dockerfiles yourself.

Feedback
--------
Don't judge this too harshly. I completed it within a self imposed time constraint and motivation which comes from last minute panic.

For any improvements or comments, file an Issue.
